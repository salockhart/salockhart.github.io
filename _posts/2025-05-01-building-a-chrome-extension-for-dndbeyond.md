title: "Building a Chrome Extension for D&D Beyond"
---

I had the opportunity to speak at Halihax's "Show & Tell" event here in Halifax, where I presented this project that I built at the tail end of 2024.

The project was the first time I'd ever built a Chrome extension, and I'd learned a lot. You can read about some of that in the previous posts, [Chrome Extensions with `esbuild`]({% post_url 2024-09-13-chrome-extensions-with-esbuild %}) and [Chrome Extensions with `rollup`]({% post_url 2024-09-14-chrome-extensions-with-rollup %}). And you can find the slides from this talk [here](/presentations/beyond-legacy?showNotes=true).
