I had the privilege of speaking at HFX.js today about Microfrontends. At Datasite, we've been using Webpack Module Federation for over a year now with a lot of success, and I was happy to be able to share some of what I'd learned with the community!

It was also a great opportunity too to get some slides together explaining how to get started.

Speaking of which:

- The slides can be found [here](/presentations/microfrontends-and-module-federation?showNotes=true).
- The code can be found [here](https://github.com/salockhart/module-federation-example).
